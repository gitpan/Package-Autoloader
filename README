Package::Autoloader - generic autoloading for packages

This module is a complement to L<Package::Transporter>, adding the
functionality for DMN_AUTOLOAD. However, it can also stand on its own,
increasing the potential for code re-use.

Package::Autoloader supplies packages with subroutine definitions on
the fly. Once a missing subroutine is encountered in a package, Perl's
autoload mechanism is triggered and groups of rules are checked for a
matching generator. By default a missing subroutine is generated
inside a package by an eval().
