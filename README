Package::Autoloader - modular wrapper for 'AUTOLOAD' with dynamic export

This is an experimental module and in relation to its complexity there are not enough tests available to consider it ready for general production use, yet.

Package::Autoloader can be seen as a class for AUTOLOAD objects, which are managed behind a system of convenience methods. The system exports potential instead of drain to other packages. The potential can be tested with two functions, potentially_can and potentially_defined. For details, read the man page for Package::Autoloader.

You might want to run the examples from the directory of the same name.
