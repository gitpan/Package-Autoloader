Package::Autoloader was a fork from Package::Transporter and has finally been merged back. Version 0.15 of Package::Autoloader can be considered to be the same as version 0.80 of Package::Transporter. It has greatly speed up the development of the interface with a convincing result in terms of convenience and consistency. But it is no longer needed as a separate package, therefore removing it from CPAN. This notice will also go soon, because Package::Autoloader was never intended for production use.
