Although it appears that the interfaces finally settle, don't take them
for granted. Anything might change. Only install if you're adventerous.

Other than that, Package::Autoloader is fairly straightforward in terms of
installation. 

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Package::Autoloader makes use of the follwoing external modules, most of which are part of the Perl5 core. I guess it only works for perl 5.10 upwards, because of the mro stuff and parent.

	Scalar::Util
	mro
	parent
	Carp
	Test::Simple (for installation)

The example files and some generators require these additional modules:

	Data::Dumper
	Fcntl
	SDBM_File
	DBI (not in the core, but widely found)
